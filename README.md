# Haze: macOS Downloader
A simple Terminal utility for downloading macOS installers.

> Consider using the [Mist GUI](https://github.com/ninxsoft/Mist). It offers the same functionality as this script but with a more user-friendly and feature-rich interface.

## This script is undergoing a redesign! Stay tuned for more.
In the meantime, what should we call the project? <br>
Haze? <br>
MistCLI? <br>
I think we'll go with Haze, a lower quality mist. <br>
